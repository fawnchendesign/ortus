It\u2019s incredibly handy for writing scripts and \u000d\u000aexpressions that save the designers \u000d\u000atime.\u201d And it\u2019s not just the Magpie \u000d\u000aStudio team who\u2019ve found it useful. \u000d\u000a\u201cWe\u2019ve even used Midjourney to \u000d\u000acreate the images for a cocktail bar \u000d\u000aidentity for Lyaness, which has gone \u000d\u000adown really well with the client and \u000d\u000atheir customers,\u201d says Christie.\u000d\u000aMagpie \u000d\u000aStudio uses AI \u000d\u000afor branding\u000d\u000a12 ","Connor Edwards, a designer at \u000d\u000aJack Renwick Studio, sees AI as \u000d\u000aan exciting new tool, similar to \u000d\u000aPhotoshop or Cinema 4D. But like \u000d\u000aany tool, it has its limitations. \u000d\u000aSimon Elliott, partner at Rose, can \u000d\u000aalso see some positives to AI: \u201cI can \u000d\u000asee the benefit and appeal in cutting \u000d\u000adown the time to create iterative \u000d\u000atests and design developments. I can \u000d\u000aalso see how this will help jobbing \u000d\u000agraphic designers and those needing \u000d\u000ato output communications from outside our profession. So I think these \u000d\u000akind of changes are already proving \u000d\u000abeneficial in some areas of design.\u201d \u000d\u000a\u201c\u000d\u000aAI doesn\u2019t yet make the creative connections that \u000d\u000aa human brain does \u2014 those weird and wonderful \u000d\u000aobservations that aren\u2019t always logical or are some-times \u000d\u000acompletely based on chance. Until AI can make these \u000d\u000akinds of leaps, it\u2019s hard to see it as more than a tool to \u000d\u000ahelp people execute their own ideas.\u000d\u000a13 ","The risks of using AI\u000d\u000aAlongside the excitement around \u000d\u000athis new technology, there is also a \u000d\u000asense of unease, says Tan. \u201cWhile \u000d\u000athe tools have become inescapably \u000d\u000auseful in my day to day \u2014 it feels \u000d\u000aimportant to think more deeply \u000d\u000aabout how we let this technology \u000d\u000ashape our industry and what the \u000d\u000along-lasting impact can be on not \u000d\u000aonly how we work, but on the \u000d\u000avalue of creativity at the core of our \u000d\u000aindustry.\u201dThere are a few things in \u000d\u000aparticular that worry Tan, \u201cIt\u2019s hard \u000d\u000anot to feel like the value of art, and \u000d\u000athat of artists, has fallen with the \u000d\u000aease with which these images can \u000d\u000anow be spirited out of thin air with a \u000d\u000asimple line of text,\u201d she says. She\u2019s \u000d\u000aalso worried about AI contributing to \u000d\u000athe \u201cblandification\u201d of web design or \u000d\u000abranding. \u201cThe problem will only get \u000d\u000aworse as tremendous amounts of \u000d\u000adata continue to be spewed forward \u000d\u000aby AI generation, feeding into the \u000d\u000asea of sameness, and gorging itself \u000d\u000aon polluted pools of data so that \u000d\u000awe are training AI on AI-generated \u000d\u000adata. As lovers of design, we need \u000d\u000ato do everything we can to avoid \u000d\u000athat.Edwards has similar concerns. \u000d\u000a\u201cWe\u2019re concerned that AI could \u000d\u000afurther homogenise the creative \u000d\u000aoutput of our industry. AI learns from \u000d\u000athe inputs we all provide, so if we \u000d\u000aprompt AI with something, it will \u000d\u000ainevitably reproduce it for someone \u000d\u000aelse, somewhere. This is similar to \u000d\u000aeveryone drawing inspiration from \u000d\u000athe same trending images on their \u000d\u000aPinterest feeds.\u201d\u000d\u000aOwnership and copyright concerns \u000d\u000awere also areas of concern. \u201cAs AI \u000d\u000agathers data from images across the \u000d\u000ainternet, questions arise about who \u000d\u000aowns these new creations,\u201d says \u000d\u000aEdwards. \u201cCan they be licensed for \u000d\u000ause in creative work? Should the \u000d\u000aoriginal creators of the source \u000d\u000aimagery receive credit? Is there a \u000d\u000arisk that talented creatives might \u000d\u000aget ripped off?\u201d \u000d\u000a\u201cThere are already issues with \u000d\u000acreative IP and AI,\u201d agrees Christie, \u000d\u000a\u201cand without proper regulation this is \u000d\u000aonly going to get worse. AI is developing so fast, it\u2019s already becoming \u000d\u000ahard to tell human-generated from \u000d\u000aAI-generated imagery. We\u2019re hopeful \u000d\u000athat legal minds will quickly figure \u000d\u000aout how to control authorship in a \u000d\u000aDesign Bridge and Partners uses \u000d\u000aAI for installation\u000d\u000a14 ","Use AI to become more creative \u2014 but not if you want \u000d\u000ato be more original\u000d\u000a Jessica Tan, Design Bridge and Partners\u000d\u000afair and manageable way. In the \u000d\u000ameantime, it\u2019s best to flag when \u000d\u000ait\u2019s used so that authorship is clear, \u000d\u000aand people still get credit for their \u000d\u000awork.\u201dThe speed with which AI \u000d\u000acan produce images can be seen \u000d\u000aas a benefit, but there\u2019s a flipside, \u000d\u000atoo. Elliott notes that it could lead \u000d\u000ato laziness or over-reliance in some \u000d\u000adesigners, but that it could also \u000d\u000aeffect clients too. \u201c[AI could] fuel \u000d\u000aclient expectation of faster delivery, \u000d\u000ain a world where everyone already \u000d\u000aexpects everything yesterday.\u201d\u000d\u000aAI\u2019s impact on creativity is also \u000d\u000apotentially an issue: \u201cA recent study \u000d\u000ashows that while AI can improve the \u000d\u000acreative output of any given individual, it can hinder a highly creative \u000d\u000aperson by anchoring their thinking,\u201d \u000d\u000asays Tan. \u201cThe conclusion?

And especially so when I learned of \u000d\u000aframeworks that could allow anyone to use anyone\u2019s personal identity and both reimagine and \u000d\u000adecontextualize them by using a prompt of a \u000d\u000afew words.

Here\u2019s the tale of \u000d\u000athis emotional rollercoaster; \u000d\u000a23 ","my concerns and also my excitement.\u000d\u000aI started my AI image explorations with MidJourney. I \u000d\u000aused this tool to playfully reimagine the identities of celebrities. My prompts included, \u201cDiana Ross in decadent \u000d\u000aart nouveau advertisement for Fanta soda,\u201d \u201cMalcolm X \u000d\u000aas Drake in the Nothing Was the Same album cover,\u201d\u000d\u000a\u201cMegan Thee Stallion as Mona Lisa in the style of \u000d\u000aBasquiat,\u201d \u201cObama in an Adidas tracksuit with an \u000d\u000aafro in pop art style\u201d, \u201cSade in a Hype Williams music \u000d\u000avideo,\u201d \u201cLenny Kravitz in a 1960\u2019s Havana Cuba poster,\u201d \u000d\u000a\u201cFrederick Douglass taking a selfie for Instagram,\u201d and \u000d\u000a\u201cRihanna for President\u201d\u000d\u000aThis felt ok for a few reasons: 1. The personally \u000d\u000aestablished identity of a celebrity is typically well-known \u000d\u000aand their images are everywhere; 2. Their identities are \u000d\u000aoften meme-ified (many of which I\u2019ve seen them share \u000d\u000aonline themselves); 3. The renderings of these images \u000d\u000aare low quality and illustrative \u2014 they could not possibly \u000d\u000abe confused for reality or truth.\u000d\u000aThen I learned of Stable Diffusion and things got a bit \u000d\u000amurkier. I was able to render photorealistic imagery of \u000d\u000ajust about anything I could write in words. Deepfakes \u000d\u000ahave already been a societal concern, but this felt \u000d\u000anext-level. It has made the opportunity to create a \u000d\u000adeepfake instantaneous. Knowing how society is \u000d\u000aalready hanging on such a fragile thread when it comes \u000d\u000ato trust of information, this felt negatively detrimental to \u000d\u000aour ability to operate as a healthy society if gotten into \u000d\u000athe wrong hands. I worried about the cyberbullying of \u000d\u000amiddle schoolers, political propaganda especially in rural \u000d\u000aareas when understandings of deepfake technologies \u000d\u000alike these might not be well known, revenge porn, and \u000d\u000agenerally those that want to fuel societal misinformation \u000d\u000aand mistrust. And this technology makes it way too \u000d\u000aeasy for this to be done when not regulated. It made \u000d\u000ame want to stay away from it and encourage others to \u000d\u000ado the same.\u000d\u000aBut then I started using it to explore the mash up \u000d\u000abetween my identity and others. And between my identity, and attributes I have and don\u2019t have. When doing \u000d\u000a24 ","the mash up of existing identities, I used a headshot of \u000d\u000amyself, then prompted the model to render me in the \u000d\u000aform of mostly different Black women. The results were \u000d\u000aastonishing. It was intriguing to see how the way I\u2019ve \u000d\u000arepresented myself was then imposed on women both \u000d\u000alike and very different from me. I, presenting myself \u000d\u000arelatively \u201cconservative\u201d (fully clothed, hair pulled back, \u000d\u000aminimal make-up), was now being used to form new \u000d\u000aidentities of women who have entirely different ways of \u000d\u000arepresenting themselves.\u000d\u000aTo study what it maintained with my identity (body \u000d\u000aposture, shirt, hair pulled back, and usually my relatively \u000d\u000astoic expression) and did not maintain (amount of makeup, accessories, direction of eyes, and sometimes facial \u000d\u000aexpressions) and how it blended our identities was fascinating. I wondered why it was making the decisions \u000d\u000a25 ","26 ","that it did. I then went further, uploading a photo of myself and \u000d\u000aprompting different characteristic attributes like \u201cimportant\u201d and \u000d\u000a\u201cscientist\u201d to see how it would then render me.\u000d\u000aThe results continued to fascinate me. I am currently a 29 \u000d\u000ayears old Black woman artist and programmer, who reads a lot of \u000d\u000abooks and drinks a lot of tea, was born in my Miami to Dominican \u000d\u000aparents, an aunt, grew up playing tennis, and generally have a \u000d\u000acalm nature. To see how it would darken or lighten my skin (even \u000d\u000achange my race and sometimes gender i.e. \u201c29 years old\u201d and \u000d\u000a\u201cprogrammer,\u201d respectively), change my facial expression, etc. \u000d\u000abased off these different attributes lead to a lot of questions. I \u000d\u000aalso studied how it would modify me with attributes that I didn\u2019t \u000d\u000acurrently identify. While it illuminated harmful assumptions, it \u000d\u000awas not entirely surprising. \u000d\u000aThat doesn\u2019t mean I believe its inaccuracy shouldn\u2019t be challenged, I do. But I also found that I could look at its results as a \u000d\u000away of studying this current society. This then prompted the idea \u000d\u000aof labeling this practice, \u201cComputational Anthropology.\u201d \u2003\u2003\u2003\u000d\u000aI proceeded in this direction by studying the relationship \u000d\u000abetween AI and the archive. In the Public Domain, I found a \u000d\u000acollection of imagery from missionaries traveling throughout the \u000d\u000aglobal South. I would use the text that described each image as \u000d\u000aa prompt to enter into Stable Diffusion to generate new images. \u000d\u000aAnd again, I was fascinated by the results. The text \u201cOtzk\u00f6 Kazo\u201d \u000d\u000athat\u2019s placed over the images is the title of a larger art project I \u000d\u000aam exploring and will share more information about in the future.\u000d\u000aI was shocked at generally how well it could recreate the \u000d\u000aoriginal imagery by only having the text prompt/archival caption to \u000d\u000agenerate from. I studied what it would get incorrectly \u2014 my favorite being the image of Benjamin \u201cPap\u201d Singleton. The original \u000d\u000aimage is of a Black man, but Stable Diffusion identified Pap to be \u000d\u000awhite \u2014 though assumed correctly the type of facial hair he must \u000d\u000aHow does the machine (which I use synonymously for AI, \u000d\u000acomputation, online society, etc.) see us based on how \u000d\u000awe\u2019ve presented ourselves, and designed it to see us? \u000d\u000aWhat can we learn from our own metadata?\u000d\u000a\u201c\u000d\u000aAI is simply a reflection of its maker and/or the society in \u000d\u000awhich it is based off of.

Sometimes I would add additional information \u000d\u000ato the prompt like \u201cin National Geographic\u201d or \u201cby \u000d\u000aAfrican Photographers\u201d to observe the nuance in \u000d\u000aimage generation when given additional context. With \u000d\u000a\u201cNational Geographic\u201d, it would often romanticize the \u000d\u000aimage. When taken \u201cby [an] African photographer\u201d, \u000d\u000athe subject would pose for the photographer \u2014 face \u000d\u000abeing directed towards the camera. When taken \u201cby \u000d\u000a[a] White photographer\u201d, the face of the subject would \u000d\u000abe turned away, seemingly candid \u2014 for me, it identified an effect of voyeurism when someone outside of \u000d\u000aa community is documenting that community. With the \u000d\u000aminstrel image, it eradicated the \u201cBlackness\u201d of the \u000d\u000aoriginal subject and made all the posters of non-Black \u000d\u000asubjects with \u201cnon-Black\u201d characteristics. I\u2019m excited \u000d\u000ato continue pushing these explorations with AI and the \u000d\u000aarchive.\u000d\u000aMost recently, I\u2019ve been back to studying my own \u000d\u000aidentity with AI synthesis. By using DreamBooth on \u000d\u000atop of Stable Diffusion, I\u2019m allowed to create a model \u000d\u000aof any subject and create drastic alterations through \u000d\u000atext-to-image diffusion.\u000d\u000aAs I\u2019ve gotten to know the tool better, I\u2019ve been \u000d\u000aable to use it to render these both astonishingly surreal \u000d\u000aand lucid reinterpretations of myself. This practice \u000d\u000ahas pushed me into philosophical wormholes on my \u000d\u000aown identity. I\u2019ve found that this notion of identity can \u000d\u000aonly exist in the external world by how we present \u000d\u000aourselves. But, it actually becomes non-existent in our \u000d\u000ainternal worlds. When we realize how boundless and \u000d\u000aamorphous our personal idea of our own identity truly is, \u000d\u000awe can better understand that the breadth of our own \u000d\u000anuance can\u2019t be contained in this idea of \u201cidentity.\u201d As \u000d\u000aI\u2019ve created these images, I\u2019ve deeply questioned my \u000d\u000aown identity/how I\u2019ve presented myself to the world \u000d\u000aand how invested I\u2019ve been in the way I\u2019ve been perceived \u2014 as many of us are. I\u2019ve used this to explore \u000d\u000amyself in alternate realities, engaging in activities I haven\u2019t done (like sipping champagne on a small yacht off \u000d\u000athe Amalfi coast, to being a supermodel and having a \u000d\u000a28 ","photo shoot in front of the Egyptian pyramids, to being \u000d\u000aa NASA astronaut in outer space).\u000d\u000aThe way I\u2019ve rendered these images is not as \u000d\u000ahyperrealistic as it has the ability to be, as I like \u000d\u000athe aesthetic of film, surrealism, and the caricature \u000d\u000adistortion of my body. I also don\u2019t use names of other \u000d\u000aartists in my prompt as it feels uncomfortable to mimic \u000d\u000aother\u2019s artistic styles so directly. But to see myself in \u000d\u000athese glamorous compositions has certainly impacted \u000d\u000amy psyche and sense of confidence in ways I didn\u2019t \u000d\u000aexpect. Currently, I have not experienced this tool to \u000d\u000ause aesthetic-based attributes to change the structure \u000d\u000aof my face to become more \u201cattractive\u201d like many \u000d\u000aface altering apps are intended to do. Instead, this \u000d\u000atool will modify my attractiveness with makeup, facial \u000d\u000aexpression, and hair. So overall, it\u2019s the opportunity \u000d\u000ato see my currently structured face glamorized and in \u000d\u000aextravagant settings, that offers a level of excitement \u000d\u000aand empowerment. It offers this insight that if I wanted to have a glamorous portrait of myself in the reality \u000d\u000aI physically sit in, it would only be a matter of doing \u000d\u000amy hair and makeup in a certain way, being in the right \u000d\u000asetting, having the right photographer, etc. \u2014 as these \u000d\u000asimulated alternate realities have exemplified. For me, \u000d\u000ait emphasized that these images are not impossible, \u000d\u000abut instead just have yet to be realized in this way. To \u000d\u000adistort my image, have hair or clothing in styles I\u2019ve \u000d\u000a\u201c\u000d\u000aAs I\u2019ve bended and shifted \u000d\u000amy identity through this tool, \u000d\u000aI\u2019ve examined my way of being \u000d\u000aonline and in the real world.\u000d\u000a29 ","never even thought of is surprisingly mind bending \u2014 I \u000d\u000afeel encouraged to step more out of my comfort zone \u000d\u000aand explore different styles. Yet I also feel more comfortable caring even less about how I\u2019ve styled my hair \u000d\u000aand clothing because now I see that if I wanted to look \u000d\u000aa certain way, I always could. I often think about how \u000d\u000aothers might experience engaging with this tool and \u000d\u000ahow it could impact their sense of self and confidence. \u000d\u000aThese explorations may come across as vain or narcissistic, but the effects are human, and profound. \u000d\u000aBeing a lifelong artist and photographer, I\u2019ve grown \u000d\u000aup taking self portraits and used to love collaging and \u000d\u000adistorting my portraits into new forms. I\u2019ve always \u000d\u000agiven a sense of importance to the practice of image making, presentation of my identity, legacy, and \u000d\u000athe investment in collective consciousness. And to \u000d\u000ahumbly compare myself with these large icons, it feels \u000d\u000asimilar to the way Malcolm X and Frederick Douglass \u000d\u000aunderstood the importance of imagery when trying to \u000d\u000acommunicate their messages. My sense of urgency \u000d\u000ato publicly use this tool on myself also comes from \u000d\u000aunderstanding the impact of imagery on the collective \u000d\u000aconsciousness. For example, even as a technologist I \u000d\u000aoften immediately get anxious with AI \u2014 often partially \u000d\u000abecause I\u2019ve been inundated with horror stories of AI in \u000d\u000aHollywood. There are plenty of reasons to be worried \u000d\u000aabout the development of AI outside of Hollywood \u2014 \u000d\u000abut it\u2019s also important to recognize media\u2019s impact. I\u2019ve \u000d\u000ahad my heart broken when listening to young Black \u000d\u000agirls in my family pick the lighter skin characters for a \u000d\u000a\u2022As I\u2019ve bended and shifted my identity through this tool, I\u2019ve end in the real world. \u2022As I\u2019ve bended and shifted my identity th30 ","video game when their own skin is many shades darker, \u000d\u000abecause they want to be \u201cprettier.\u201d The stories we \u000d\u000alisten to and the imagery we are fed become our reality. \u000d\u000aAnd instead of fearing the worlds others have created, \u000d\u000awe can tell our own. The opportunity for me to step in \u000d\u000awhile this is relatively new, while it still produces these \u000d\u000abeautiful glitches that shows we\u2019re at the forefront of \u000d\u000asynthesizing these both real and artificial worlds, and \u000d\u000ato use it to feed Black beauty, glamour, extravagance, \u000d\u000asurrealism, and art into the collective consciousness \u000d\u000afeels important. To turn my online presence into a Black \u000d\u000awoman AI, in a world where white men are usually the \u000d\u000aloudest in these rooms and the poster child for these \u000d\u000atechnologies, means a lot to me. To make sure the \u000d\u000aBlack community knows this is happening, to invite \u000d\u000athem to get in now and so beautifully bring our flare to \u000d\u000athese technologies as we always do with everything \u000d\u000aelse, it excites me.\u000d\u000aThis has also impacted the way I\u2019ve used and understood photography outside of self-portraits. Whenever \u000d\u000aI\u2019ve traveled, half my suitcase consists of cameras. I\u2019ve \u000d\u000aloved documenting these beautiful environments and \u000d\u000asharing for others to enjoy, too. But as I\u2019ve used this \u000d\u000atool, I\u2019ve reflected a lot on my behavior with photography. I realized that when I see something beautiful \u000d\u000aand pull my camera out to document it, I\u2019m no longer \u000d\u000apresent in that moment nor can I fully enjoy it. I rarely \u000d\u000aactually even look back at photos I\u2019ve taken on my trips, \u000d\u000abecause life keeps moving and we keep seeing more \u000d\u000abeautiful things. I\u2019ve recognized a sort of scarcity that\u2019s \u000d\u000aexamined my way of being online and in the real world. \u2022As I\u2019vehrough this tool, I\u2019ve examined my way of being online and in th31 ","practiced in photography when trying to hold \u000d\u000aon to becomingly past moments instead of \u000d\u000acontinuing to fully appreciate the present.\u000d\u000aThis has also presented a distinction in \u000d\u000aimage making that I had not realized before. \u000d\u000aI now understand that with photography you \u000d\u000acan either convey an idea or capturing an \u000d\u000aauthentic moment. Often times the use of \u000d\u000aphotography for social media is to convey \u000d\u000aan idea \u2014 convey that I\u2019m drinking tea, or \u000d\u000aon a walk in a beautiful garden, or wearing \u000d\u000aa super fun outfit. And I\u2019m able to use this \u000d\u000atool to convey ideas without having to use \u000d\u000amy camera directly. But I could not use it to \u000d\u000aconvey a moment that I have an emotional \u000d\u000aattachment to, because I\u2019ve experienced it in \u000d\u000aits raw, physical reality form. I wouldn\u2019t use \u000d\u000athis tool to replicate taking photographs of my \u000d\u000aniece and nephews doing something really \u000d\u000asilly and cute \u2014 because it was that moment, \u000d\u000anot the idea of that moment, that is especially \u000d\u000aimportant to me.\u000d\u000aThis has also prompted a new art practice for me. I\u2019ve now dedicated my entire \u000d\u000ainstagram account to artificially synthesized \u000d\u000aimages of myself. I did this out of the blue \u2014 \u000d\u000aproviding no context to my online community, \u000d\u000aso that I could watch their reaction void of this \u000d\u000acontext. To my knowing, it has been received \u000d\u000areally well. The images are exciting, uncanny, \u000d\u000aand intriguing. \u000d\u000a","I\u2019m doing this as \u000d\u000aan exploration of \u000d\u000aa few things: \u000d\u000a1. The way I\u2019ve watched myself and so many \u000d\u000aothers deeply romanticize our own lives for \u000d\u000apublic consumption \u2014 causing this heightened \u000d\u000alevel of extravagance in online social spheres, \u000d\u000a2. To see if this devalues the practice of being an online influencer when the opportunity \u000d\u000ato take any image you want becomes accessible to anyone with access to the internet, \u000d\u000a3. To push myself out of rigidity in my \u000d\u000aonline and public presentation of my identity \u000d\u000aand create space for myself and others to also \u000d\u000aobserve me in different lights, \u000d\u000a4. To emphasize how our idea of \u201cconnectedness\u201d by sharing images of ourselves online \u000d\u000ais truly an illusion \u2014 I have been posting \u000d\u000aimages of myself everyday but anyone one \u000d\u000athat follows me yet is not in direct communication with me would have no idea about my \u000d\u000awell-being, location, current activities, etc. \u2014 \u000d\u000athe same goes for many of us online \u000d\u000a5. To embark on this new trajectory of art \u000d\u000amaking. This feels like I\u2019m creating an online \u000d\u000aportfolio of what\u2019s possible when synthesizing human identity with textual diffusion \u000d\u000avia AI synthesis. I get excited when thinking \u000d\u000aabout this getting in the hands of say, fashion \u000d\u000aphotographers, animators, artists, and the \u000d\u000aboundary pushing imagery we\u2019ll be able to \u000d\u000aexperience.\u000d\u000aAll In all, I still worry about and am invested \u000d\u000ain finding remedies to the negative potentials \u000d\u000aof this technology, especially ethically. This \u000d\u000aincludes the fueling of mistrust and misinformation, bullying (cyber and otherwise), revenge \u000d\u000apornography and involuntary porn, the exploitation without compensation of artist\u2019s styles, the \u000d\u000aeradication of workforces/artistic practices that \u000d\u000athis now automates, and more. But I am also \u000d\u000aexcited about this new form of empowerment \u000d\u000ain heightening one\u2019s level of confidence, the \u000d\u000aopportunity to bend and shift one\u2019s identity for \u000d\u000aartistic exploration, this entirely new era of \u201cart \u000d\u000amaking\u201d (I personally find that the use of these \u000d\u000aAI media generation tools does not automatically equate to art making but that the way they \u000d\u000aare used can create new ways of creating art), \u000d\u000aand the potential new economies that can financially empower artists who\u2019s work is currently \u000d\u000ainvoluntarily being used to power these models.\u000d\u000a33 ","It\u2019s always thrilling to look back on your life\u000d\u000aand see how often it\u2019s the smallest of interactions that \u000d\u000acompletely change your life\u2019s direction and set you on \u000d\u000aa new path.\u000d\u000aFor us, it was a conversation over a beer, where, \u000d\u000abarely knowing each other, we nervously started \u000d\u000adreaming of ways to collaborate. This small interaction \u000d\u000awas the impetus for a project that consumed the next \u000d\u000atwo years of our lives as well as became the foundation for a working relationship that, while not without \u000d\u000aits struggles, has developed into a collaboration with \u000d\u000a34 ","BUT THIS IS NOT WHAT WE \u000d\u000aARE MOST EXCITED ABOUT\u000d\u000aHAS BEEN ACQUIRED BY\u000d\u000aMoMA\u000d\u000aunexpected longevity.\u000d\u000aWe are two data visualization designers living on \u000d\u000aeither side of the Atlantic (Giorgia in New York, and \u000d\u000aStefanie in London) who live lives seemingly in parallel. \u000d\u000aWe met, and \u2014 struck by how many personal and work \u000d\u000asimilarities we shared \u2014 we wanted to get to know \u000d\u000aeach other better. So we challenged ourselves, we \u000d\u000awould do this this using the material we were most \u000d\u000afamiliar with: data. \u000d\u000aFor our project Dear Data, each week throughout a \u000d\u000ayear we collected and measured different types of personal data relating to our lives and then visualized it as \u000d\u000aa drawing on a postcard which we then sent as a type \u000d\u000aof \u201cslow data\u201d transmission of our personalities and our \u000d\u000adays to the other person.\u000d\u000aThis was first and foremost a personal project, \u000d\u000acreated in the evenings and on the weekends as our immensely-patient partners watched as we made space \u000d\u000aon our kitchen tables to draw, crumple up, throw away, \u000d\u000atear our hair out in frustration, then draw some more \u000d\u000auntil we finally had a postcard we felt was good enough \u000d\u000ato be shared with our newfound collaborator. \u000d\u000a35 ","As this project unfolded, we began to understand each \u000d\u000aothers\u2019 personal and professional foibles both in the postcards we sent each other and the messages we would \u000d\u000afuriously text back and forth as the project developed. \u000d\u000aWe shared the most revealing and vulnerable aspects of \u000d\u000aourselves: our flaws, our bad habits, and even shameful \u000d\u000arevelations from our pasts and our thoughts in the form \u000d\u000aof drawn data to be interpreted by the other person. \u000d\u000aIt\u2019s as though we were keeping a shared diary within a \u000d\u000aweekly rhythm, where we used this tool \u2014 this material \u2014 to compose a portrait of the other person through \u000d\u000athese weekly fragments of her nature.\u000d\u000aOver a year we connected at a deep level, learning to \u000d\u000alove each other\u2019s imperfections, but we could do this \u2014 \u000d\u000athough data \u2014 only because we\u2019ve been working in a \u000d\u000avery manual and personal way. In fact, as we gathered \u000d\u000aour weekly data, the process was more labour-intensive \u000d\u000athan just deriving standard metrics from technological \u000d\u000adevices: we conceived Dear Data from the beginning \u000d\u000aas a \u201cpersonal documentary\u201d more than a \u201cquantified \u000d\u000aself project\u201d where we didn\u2019t only quantify numbers but \u000d\u000awe were also adding contextual details to our logs, thus \u000d\u000amaking them truly personal, about us and us alone.\u000d\u000aAnd so Dear Data \u2014 a project that started with an \u000d\u000aalmost casual conversation \u2014 led to outcomes we never \u000d\u000aanticipated: being exhibited at Somerset House and \u000d\u000aLondon\u2019s Science Museum, winning \u2018Most Beautiful\u2019 \u000d\u000aaward (the highest accolade) at the Information is \u000d\u000aBeautiful Awards 2015, being nominated for the Design \u000d\u000aMuseum\u2019s illustrious \u20182016 Designs of the Year\u2019 awards, \u000d\u000areceived incredible attention and kind words from the \u000d\u000a\u201c But most importantly, this was a project where we put all of \u000d\u000aourselves as human beings and designers into this radical \u000d\u000aexperimentation: approaching the data we collected from as \u000d\u000asnapshots of our days and lives, and sketching our personalities \u000d\u000afor the over person to discover with the \u000d\u000amost contemporary material, data. 36 ","Drawing her first \u000d\u000apostcard, she had an \u000d\u000aidea for her whole \u000d\u000acollection: from now \u000d\u000aon every time she \u000d\u000atracks something \u000d\u000arelatated to Stefanie, \u000d\u000aor to Dear Data, she \u000d\u000auses a special pen \u000d\u000ato present it!\u000d\u000aThis week Giogia \u000d\u000aand stefanie tried \u000d\u000agathering data in \u000d\u000asmall notebooks(-\u000d\u000atedious), but soon \u000d\u000aswitched to making \u000d\u000anotes on their \u000d\u000aphone (much easier).\u000d\u000aStefanie\u2019s favourite \u000d\u000aclock to capture: a \u000d\u000abell tolling the time \u000d\u000ain a town in Devon.\u000d\u000aWeek seven: a week of clocks\u000d\u000aGiorgia\u000d\u000aStefaine\u000d\u000a37 ","Week seven: a week of complaints\u000d\u000a38 ","press and so, so many more incredible opportunities, all \u000d\u000aculminating in a self-titled book published by Penguin \u000d\u000aand Princeton Architectural Press. \u000d\u000aAs a matter of fact, our 104 original postcards and \u000d\u000athe many sketchbooks we filled with intermediate data \u000d\u000adrawings every week have found the best possible \u000d\u000ahome for years to come.

Engagements can \u000d\u000aoccupy space (3D), they can move \u000d\u000a(kinetic), they can change overtime \u000d\u000a(4D); the possibilities are nearly \u000d\u000alimitless.
